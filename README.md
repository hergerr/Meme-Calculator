# Meme-Calculator

Purpose: Load to the USB stick memes which are the most valuable

The most important part of program is function `calculate`. It solves decisive version of knapsack problem through dynamic programming algorithm. It's complexity depends on knapsack (USB stick) size and number of memes. It's computational complexity in **theta** notation is (n*W)

Where:

- **n** - number of memes,
- **W** - size of knapsack

### How to run

Type in terminal opened in project directory: python3 main.py

It works on python 3.6.7 and newer
